# hello-world

Dear diary,

it has been really long, since i last write to you. In fact, i have never been writing a diary. And this is not a diary neuther, just a test file on GitHub. These thoughts could be utter nonsense, even gibberish. I have been wasting too much time writing all these, gonna hang up now.

yours sincerely, Dia
